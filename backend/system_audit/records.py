"""Which records are audited, and which of their fields may be shown.

Every entry here is two decisions made deliberately and written down:

1. **What is collected.** The tuple is an allowlist. A column not named cannot
   reach the audit log, whatever a write path does later, so adding a column to
   a table does not quietly add it to the history of that table.

2. **What may be read back.** ``redact`` names the fields that record *that*
   they changed without recording *what to*. Those fields are stored as a digest
   of their own value, so an edit to a learner's date of birth still shows up as
   an edit to a learner's date of birth, by a named person, at a known time --
   and the date of birth itself is nowhere in the log.

The rule applied throughout: personal detail about a human being is redacted;
the operational facts of their enrolment are not. Somebody's programme, cohort,
status, dates and access level are what an audit is for. Their address, phone
number and national insurance number are not, and an audit log that copied them
would be a second, less-guarded copy of the very data it exists to protect.

**The Coach workspace is an exception, made deliberately.** Its free text --
meeting notes, absence reasons, review answers and marking feedback -- is
recorded in full rather than redacted, because the question that workspace's
trail exists to answer is what a coach actually wrote before somebody changed
it, and a digest cannot answer it. The cost is real and belongs here in writing:
those words are a learner's health, home circumstances and assessed work, and
they now live in the history table as well as in the record, for as long as the
history is kept. Reversing it is a one-line change per record type -- name the
columns in `redact` again.

Left out of the allowlists entirely, rather than redacted, because they are a
capability rather than a fact: meeting join links and evidence image URLs. A
digest of a link is useless, and the link itself is a way in.

    ``register_enrolment_records`` above covers the *records* enrolment
    maintains -- a learner, a staff account, an employer, an organisation. This
    covers the *process*: booking an eligibility review, answering it, signing
    an apprenticeship agreement, completing a training plan. Those are the
    actions somebody asks an audit trail about after the fact -- "who decided
    this learner was eligible", "when was that agreement signed and by whom" --
    and until now none of them left a trace.

    One rule decides every allowlist here, and it is the one the module docstring
    states: the operational facts of an enrolment are recorded in full, and
    personal detail about a human being is redacted to a digest. A funding
    decision, a signature date, a programme status and a compliance answer are
    what an audit is for. A date of birth, an address and a unique learner
    number are not.

    Every ``*_signature`` column is left out of its allowlist entirely rather
    than redacted. They hold a PNG data URL drawn in the browser, so a digest of
    one says nothing a reader could use and the value itself would put a
    person's handwritten signature into a second table. Who signed, under which
    name, and at what moment are all recorded -- which is what a reader of a
    signing trail actually needs.

      this follows: attendance polled from Graph is machine traffic, and
      recording it would bury the edits people actually made.
    * The reusable-signature write in ``monthly_reports`` -- it touches only the
      saved-signature columns on the learner record, and those are not
      collected, so the revision it produced would be empty by construction.
    * ``"Learner".reviews`` in ``calendar`` -- a mirror kept in step with a

      would report one booking as two events.

def register_manual_audit_records():
    """The manual audit: its plan's own event log, and the auditor's overrides.

    Two different things, and the difference is the point.

    ``plan_events`` is registered because the plan already logs itself
    properly -- ``plan_tables.log_plan_event`` writes the entity, the action,
    the value before, the value after and the actor, from ten call sites
    covering group creation and archiving, membership, months, activities and
    exemptions. Surfacing that log is strictly better than re-deriving the same
    events from the six plan tables it describes, which would produce a second
    and vaguer account of each one.

    The overrides are registered because they log nothing. Each is an upsert
    carrying only ``updated_by`` and ``updated_at``, and between them they set a
    learner's hours, the dates that decide which month their evidence counts in,
    and whether a month is signed off at all.

    Both hours tables keep their real composite key and gain a synthetic one for
    the trail to index by; ``manual_audit_api.audit_trail`` explains why, and
    what would have gone wrong without it.
