"""Recording what an auditor changed, for the Audit Trail.

The ``"Audit"`` schema's override and annotation tables are all upserts: a
correction overwrites the previous one in place. Each carries ``updated_by`` and
``updated_at``, so the row says who touched it *last* -- and nothing at all says
what it held before, or who set that. An auditor moving a piece of evidence from
one month to another moves which month its hours count in, and until now that
edit left only a timestamp behind.

Two things this module exists to get right.

**The sandbox must never write live history.** ``/hours_test_api/`` serves these
same views against ``audit_clone``, a separate Neon branch, precisely so hours
can be edited without touching live data. But ``versioning`` writes its
revisions through the default connection whatever alias the business write
used, so recording a clone edit would put a HOURS-TEST change into the *live*
trail, described as though it had happened to a real learner. That is worse than
not recording it, so :func:`record_audit_rows` refuses in clone mode and says so
in the log rather than silently.

**Actual hours are deliberately not here.** ``actual_hours`` already has a
purpose-built history that is stronger than this one:
``"Last_audit"."activity_actual_hours_revision"`` stores the previous and
proposed values, who proposed and who decided, each with their source, a
snapshot of the source state, a base fingerprint that makes a stale approval
impossible, and the rule version it was computed under. Duplicating that into
the generic trail would add a second, weaker account of the same event.
