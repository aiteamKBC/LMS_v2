"""Real-time engagement-points hook for learner progress.

Single entry point called from `learner_api.active_users.save_progress_record`
via `transaction.on_commit(..., using="enrolment")` the instant a progress row
actually commits — every progress-recording path (quiz, video, component)
funnels through that one function, so this is the one place award logic for
progress-driven points lives.

Fired post-commit (not inline) because progress and engagement route to
different Django DB aliases — `enrolment` vs `default` — even though both
currently point at the same Neon database (see `learner_api.routers`). An
inline grant inside the progress transaction could survive a later rollback
of that very save; on_commit cannot.

Contract with the caller: this function is BEST-EFFORT and must NEVER raise —
a points failure must not surface as a progress-save error the learner never
asked about. The caller's on_commit registration also can't propagate an
exception anywhere useful by the time it fires, so the guarantee has to live
here.

KNOWN GAP (out of scope here): `save_progress_record`'s callers accept any
quiz/component id without verifying it belongs to *this* learner's assigned
training plan — so this hook can be driven by an activity the learner was
never assigned. Closing that means adding an assignment check to the quiz/
video/component submission endpoints in `learner_api`, which is a change to
the core progress-recording path (OTJH hours, KSB coverage) with a much
larger blast radius than engagement itself, and needs its own dedicated pass
against the training-plan-assignment schema rather than a guess made from here.

    `record` is the same dict `save_progress_record` was called with — a
    "kind" ("quiz" | "video" | "component"), an "attempt" (1-based), and
    kind-specific fields (`componentType` for "component").

    Points are awarded ONCE PER LEARNER PER ACTIVITY, on the FIRST ATTEMPT ONLY:
      - quiz      -> "quiz_passed", only if attempt == 1 AND the attempt passed.
                     A failed first attempt earns nothing, even if a later retake passes.
      - video     -> "recorded_session_attended", only on the first watch (attempt 1).
      - component -> rule from `_COMPONENT_TYPE_RULES` by `componentType`, first
                     completion only; component types not in that map earn nothing.

    Never raises: a missing/inactive rule, a DB error, anything — all swallowed
    and logged, so a dropped grant never surfaces as a progress-save failure.
