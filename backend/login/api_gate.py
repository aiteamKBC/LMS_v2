"""Reject callers at the front of the API, before any view runs.

Why this exists
---------------
``permissions.py`` gates endpoints one decorator at a time, and that worked
while the gated set was small. It had not kept up: ``curriculum_api`` (86
routes), ``audit_api`` (59), ``manual_audit_api`` (49), ``engagement_api`` (24)
and ``quiz_api`` (13) carried no authentication of any kind. Every one of them
answered a caller with no cookie -- so the whole curriculum, every cohort roster
and every audit record could be read by anybody who knew a URL, with no account
and no sign-in.

Closing that per-view would mean ~230 decorator edits, each of them a chance to
miss one, and the next route added would start life open again. A prefix gate
inverts that: an app is protected by naming it once here, and a new endpoint
inside a gated app is closed the moment it is routed.

What it answers
---------------
Two questions, in order: is there a live session, and is the caller's *role* one
this prefix serves. Nothing about *which records* -- that is still the job of
``staff_only``, ``require_access``, ``employer_or_staff`` and the enrolment gate,
which run afterwards and are what stop one signed-in account reaching another's
data. Deleting a decorator because this exists would re-open exactly that.

Either identity counts, matching ``enrolment_api.auth``: the platform's own
``kbc_session`` cookie, or a Django ``contrib.auth`` session, so the admin site
and the chat app's Django-session users are not locked out of endpoints they
could already reach. A Django-auth user carries no platform role, so it settles
the session question and is not subject to the role one -- it is an operator
signed into the admin site.

Choosing the role for a prefix
------------------------------
Each rule below was set from what actually calls the prefix in the SPA, not from
what the name suggests. Two would have been wrong on the obvious guess:

* ``curriculum_api`` is not staff-only -- ``pages/learner/video-watch`` renders
  ``SlideDeckViewer``, which reads the presentation endpoint. That one path is
  carved out; the other 85 are staff.
* ``engagement_api`` is not staff-only either. The learner clubs, events and
  rewards pages are built on it, so it stays at "any signed-in account".

``API_REQUIRE_AUTH=0`` turns the gate off, matching ``LEARNER_API_REQUIRE_AUTH``
and ``ENROLMENT_API_REQUIRE_AUTH`` in shape and intent: local development and
tests that run with no session. It must never be set in a deployment.

#: occurrence, the only one that says what actually broke, is buried under its
#: own repetitions at exactly the moment somebody is reading the log to find it.
#:
#: So the traceback is written at most once per interval per kind of failure,

ANY = None

#: ``(url prefix, roles allowed)``, applied longest-prefix-first -- so a specific

#:
#: Every prefix ends in "/" so "/audit_api_public/" could not be matched by
#: "/audit_api". A path matching no rule is not gated at all; the three
#: deliberate omissions are:
#:
#: ``/login_api/``
#:     Owns signing in, password reset, invitation acceptance and the health
#:     check. All of it is reached *before* there is a session; gating it would
#:     make the door require the key it hands out. It runs its own throttling
#:     and lockout, and its token endpoints validate a single-use signed token.
#: ``/api/chat/``
#:     Already gated properly per-view (``IsAuthenticated`` plus participant
#:     checks on every conversation and message route). Its two ``AllowAny``
#:     routes are the session bootstrap itself -- the same reasoning as above.
#: ``/api/calendar/``
#:     The Google and Microsoft calendar OAuth callbacks, and nothing else --
#:     the learner's actual calendar data is under ``/learner_api/``, which is
#:     gated. A callback arrives as a top-level redirect *from the provider* and
#:     authenticates on the signed 10-minute ``state`` it carries, never on the
#:     session; ``microsoft_sso.py``'s callback is ungated for the same reason.
#:     Gating it would make connecting a calendar depend on the session cookie
#:     surviving a cross-site navigation, and fail as raw JSON where a redirect
#:     belongs.
#:
#: ``/django_admin/`` and ``/media/`` are likewise absent: the admin has its own
#: login, and media is served by the reverse proxy rather than routed here.
