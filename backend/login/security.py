"""Credential and token primitives: hashing, token minting, lockout, throttling.

Everything here is deliberately independent of Django's request/response layer so
it can be reasoned about (and tested) on its own. The views in ``views.py`` are
thin wrappers over these functions.

Design notes
------------
**Password hashing** uses ``django.contrib.auth.hashers``, which is configured
project-wide (PBKDF2-SHA256 by default; Argon2 if ``argon2-cffi`` is installed —
see ``PASSWORD_HASHERS`` guidance in the README section this feature adds). We do
not hand-roll a KDF.

**Tokens** (session, invitation, reset) are 256 bits from ``secrets.token_urlsafe``.
Only ``sha256`` of the token is persisted. SHA-256 rather than a slow KDF is
correct here and not an oversight: unlike a password, the token already has full
entropy, so there is no dictionary to grind and a slow hash would only add
latency to every authenticated request.

**Comparisons** of hashes use ``hmac.compare_digest``. The database lookup is by
the hash itself (an indexed equality), so the timing signal there is a b-tree
probe, not a byte-by-byte compare of a secret.

**Lockout** is per-account, with an exponential-ish backoff capped at
``LOCKOUT_MAX_MINUTES``. **Throttling** is per-IP and per-email over a sliding
window read from the audit table, which stops a spray across many accounts that
per-account lockout alone would not.
