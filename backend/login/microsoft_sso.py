"""Sign in with Microsoft — OAuth authorization-code flow against Entra ID.

    GET /login_api/microsoft/start/     -> {"authorizationUrl": ...} (XHR)
    GET /login_api/microsoft/callback/  -> sets the session cookie, redirects

**What this does and does not do.** It authenticates *who the person is* with
Microsoft, then looks that address up in ``auth."Login_accounts"``. An address
Microsoft vouches for that has no active account here is refused. This flow
never mints an account: the login table stays the single register of who may in,
so removing somebody from it removes them from the platform whatever their
tenant still says about them.

Everything after the lookup is the ordinary sign-in path — ``register_success``,
``issue_session``, ``set_session_cookie`` — so an SSO session is revocable,
expires and audits exactly like a password one. The audit row is written with
``reason="microsoft_sso"`` so the two can be told apart after the fact.

**Why the email and not the ID token.** The address comes from a Graph ``/me``
call made with the freshly-issued access token, the same way
``learner_api.calendar_connections._oauth_identity`` reads it. Trusting a token
we just received over TLS from the token endpoint, in exchange for a code we
just minted, needs no JWKS fetch, no signature validation and no clock-skew
handling — three things that are easy to get subtly and silently wrong.

**CSRF on the callback.** The callback is a top-level browser redirect, so the
``X-Requested-With`` header the rest of the login API requires cannot be set on
it. The defence is instead a signed, salted, ten-minute ``state`` minted by
``start``, *bound to the browser that asked for it* by a paired nonce cookie —
so neither a forged callback nor a genuine one lifted from somebody else's
browser can sign anybody in. See the note above ``_nonce_cookie_kwargs``.
