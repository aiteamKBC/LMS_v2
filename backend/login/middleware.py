"""Attach the login identity to every request.

Runs once per request so any view — including the existing ``learner_api`` and
``enrolment_api`` views — can read ``request.login_account`` without importing
the session machinery or paying for a second lookup.

It never rejects a request: authorisation belongs to the decorators in
``permissions.py``, and a middleware that blanket-401s would break the health
and login endpoints themselves.

Failures are swallowed. If the auth database is briefly unreachable, an
anonymous request must still be served rather than 500ing the whole site; the
protected views will then correctly refuse it as unauthenticated.

    its own ``Max-Age`` says — so a renewal the response never carries back
    leaves the person signed out at the original time regardless. The request
