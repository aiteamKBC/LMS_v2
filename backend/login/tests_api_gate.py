"""Tests for the API gate (``login.api_gate``).

These live in the ``login`` suite deliberately. ``config/settings.py`` turns the
gate off for ``manage.py test`` so the curriculum/audit/engagement suites --
which predate any authentication on those endpoints -- keep passing; these tests
turn it back on explicitly, so the gate is still covered rather than merely
disabled.

Nothing here reaches the database. An anonymous request has no ``kbc_session``
cookie and ``resolve_session`` short-circuits on a falsy token; the role tests
use a stub account rather than a row, because the gate reads nothing from one
but ``.role``. Hence ``SimpleTestCase``.
