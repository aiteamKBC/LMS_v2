"""Test runner that provisions the unmanaged Neon tables into the test database.

The `login` models — like every other Neon-backed model in this project — are
``managed = False``, and ``EnrolmentRouter.allow_migrate`` returns False for the
enrolment connection. So Django's test runner creates ``test_neondb`` with none
of the tables the tests need, and every query fails with "relation does not
exist".

This runner closes that gap by running the same ``apply_*`` DDL commands that
provision a real environment, against the test database, immediately after it is
created. The tests then exercise the actual table shapes rather than a Django
approximation of them — which is the point, given the DDL is hand-written.

Enable it for a run:

    python manage.py test login --testrunner=login.test_runner.EnrolmentTestRunner

or make it the default by setting in config/settings.py:

    TEST_RUNNER = 'login.test_runner.EnrolmentTestRunner'
