"""Server-side session issue / resolve / revoke, and the request authenticator.

The cookie holds a random token; the database holds its SHA-256 and the state
that makes it revocable. See ``models.LoginSession`` for why this is not a JWT.

Cookie flags are set from one place (``_cookie_kwargs``) so a future change to
SameSite or the cookie name cannot drift between login, logout and renewal.
That includes *persistence*: "remember me" decides whether the browser keeps the
cookie after it closes, and issuance and renewal both read that from the session
row so the two can never disagree.

Sessions roll: activity pushes ``Expires_at`` forward so nobody is signed out
mid-task, bounded by an absolute ceiling anchored on ``Created_at`` so no session
lives for ever. ``touch_session`` renews on the way in and
``refresh_session_cookie`` extends the cookie on the way out; the middleware
carries the signal between them.

Every step of that emits a structured event on the ``login.sessions`` logger --
issued, renewed, at_ceiling, rejected, revoked -- carrying ids, a boolean and a
duration, never a token or an email. They exist so "why was I signed out?" is
answerable from the log instead of guessed at, and so the two ways a session can
end can be told apart in aggregate: see ``expiry_reason``.

    The write is one conditional ``UPDATE`` rather than a read-then-save, which
    is what makes concurrent tabs safe. Its ``WHERE`` clause carries every rule:

    ``revoked_at IS NULL``
        A revoked session is never renewed, even though it resolved a moment
        ago — a logout in another tab may have landed in between.

        near-identical targets; the later one wins and the earlier one no-ops,

    The same clause is why the ceiling cannot be jumped: ``target`` is already

       ``Set-Cookie`` — so the touch throttle governs cookie writes too, and an
       ordinary request leaves the header alone.
    2. **The response has not already spoken for the cookie.** ``set_cookie``
       and ``delete_cookie`` both leave a morsel in ``response.cookies``, so
       this single check covers sign-in, sign-out and the SSO callback without
       any of them having to know this function exists. It is what stops logout
       being followed by a middleware that helpfully puts ``kbc_session`` back.
    3. **The session was not revoked during the request.** Belt to (2) braces:
       views revoke through ``request.login_session``, so the in-memory row
       carries the revocation even before the response is built.

    undone by the very activity it was meant to survive.

    expiry, not a fresh full window, so a cookie clamped by the absolute ceiling
