"""The seam the three creation forms call into.

``learner_api`` must not import login views or reach into token internals; it
needs exactly one function: "this person was just created and the form said to
invite them — do the right thing."

``invite_subject`` is that function. It is deliberately forgiving about
*infrastructure* failure: a creation form's job is to create a person, and it
must not fail because the mail tenant is down. Problems come back in the return
value so the API response can surface them, and they land in the audit table
either way.

It is **not** forgiving about authorisation. Issuing an invitation mints a
credential, so ``invite_subject`` re-checks the caller itself rather than
trusting that whatever called it was gated — see ``_authorise``.
