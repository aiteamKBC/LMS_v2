"""Curriculum version history: capture.

Every save that changes a versioned record writes a revision holding the row as
it was saved plus a field-level diff against the previous one. Where the record
declares a version of its own -- a component's ``settings.version``, a module
reaching ``published`` -- that revision is also pinned as a named version.

Three rules shape everything below.

**A revision must never fail a save.** History is worth less than the content it
describes, so every entry point swallows its own failures and every read of the
history tables is guarded by a probe. Dropping the tables turns history off; it
does not turn saving off. See ``history_available``.

**Only real changes are recorded.** A save that rewrites a row to the values it
already held produces no revision. Without this the programme-tree save -- which
bulk-writes every component in a module on each run -- would bury the handful of
genuine edits under thousands of identical rows, and the diff between two
revisions would usually be empty.

**The actor comes from the request, not the row.** No curriculum table has an
author column. ``ActorMiddleware`` parks the signed-in account on a thread-local
for the life of the request so the write helpers, which never see the request,
can still name who saved.

# The columns a snapshot holds, per entity. Declaring them rather than taking
# whatever the caller happened to pass is what makes two write paths comparable:
# `authoring_upsert` hands over a full database row, while the programme-tree
# save hands over the payload it built, and those are not the same shape. A
# column absent from the source is stored as None, so alternating between the
# two paths cannot read as "field removed, field added" on every save.
#
# It also keeps the snapshot to the content that matters. `created_at` and

# whose row touches an integration, so its Graph identifiers are named
# deliberately (they are the meeting's identity, and requirement 1 of the Teams
# invariants is that identity is traceable) while `join_url`, `web_link` and
# `meeting_options_url` are left out: those are the capability to enter a
