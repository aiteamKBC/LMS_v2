"""Schema ownership boundary for the Curriculum app.

Background
----------
Curriculum request handlers used to call ``ensure_*_tables()`` helpers that
issued ``CREATE SCHEMA`` / ``CREATE TABLE`` / ``ALTER TABLE`` / ``CREATE INDEX``
— and, worse, historical data backfills — on the way to serving an ordinary
read. That had three consequences:

1. A plain ``GET`` could not run against a read-only connection.
2. Schema drifted implicitly at runtime instead of through migrations, so a
   dropped column silently reappeared on the next process restart.
3. Once foreign keys exist (migration 0038), a runtime backfill that rewrites a
   ``programme_id`` can raise a foreign-key violation and turn a read endpoint
   into a 500.

Design
------
Schema is owned by Django migrations in production. This module keeps the two
responsibilities apart:

``require_tables(...)``
    Read-only. Verifies the expected tables exist and raises
    ``SchemaNotProvisioned`` naming the missing relations and the migration to
    run. Never mutates anything. This is what request paths use.

``provision_schema(...)``
    Mutating. Only runs where the process is explicitly allowed to own schema —
    the SQLite test runner and local development. Production request paths never
    reach it.

``CURRICULUM_ALLOW_RUNTIME_SCHEMA_BOOTSTRAP`` (settings, default ``False``)
    Escape hatch for local Postgres development where running migrations by hand
    is inconvenient. It is *not* enabled in production.
