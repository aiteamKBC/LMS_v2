"""Cancelling a Teams calendar: one mutation per meeting, then proof it happened.

Cancelling is not the mirror image of creating or moving a meeting, and this is
why it lives apart from both.

A move can be verified by reading the new time back: the event is still there
and either says the reviewed instant or it does not. A cancellation has to be
proved by an *absence*, and Microsoft expresses that absence in more than one
way depending on what was cancelled and how far its own processing has got:

* a cancelled single meeting or series master leaves the organizer's calendar
  for Deleted Items, so reading it back answers ``ErrorItemNotFound``;
* a cancelled occurrence of a series disappears from the master's instances and
  its ``occurrenceId`` joins the master's ``cancelledOccurrences``;
* while ``/cancel``'s 202 is still being processed, the event can briefly read
  back with ``isCancelled`` already true.

The path this replaced asked only one of those questions. It cancelled the
occurrence, then handed verification to the whole-calendar reconcile sweep,
which can only recognise a cancelled occurrence through ``cancelledOccurrences``
and, failing that, reports "could not be matched" and deliberately preserves the
local status. Microsoft had genuinely cancelled the meeting, the LMS never
agreed that it had, the operation stopped at ``uncertain`` for ever, its
cancellation email -- which only goes out on ``done`` -- never went, and because
an unfinished operation blocks the next one, every later cancellation was
refused with "A previous action needs a status check".

So verification here asks Microsoft directly about the one meeting the operation
cancelled, accepts any of the answers above as proof, and saves the local status
itself. It is still read-only and still conservative: no answer short of
positive evidence is treated as a cancellation, because the reconcile sweep's
caution is right -- it simply must not be the only voice, when we are the ones
who asked for the cancellation and Microsoft accepted it.
