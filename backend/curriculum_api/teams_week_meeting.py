"""One extra Teams meeting on a single week, entirely separate from the module's.

A module's own Teams calendar is one series covering every live session it
delivers: one organiser, one invitation list, one join link per session, written
onto every live-session component by ``attach_teams_meeting_to_module_weeks``.
That is the right shape for teaching the module and the wrong shape for the
one-off -- a guest speaker for week 6, an employer panel, a resit briefing --
that has its own host, its own guests and must not appear on anybody else's
calendar.

So this books a meeting that the module's calendar cannot see and cannot touch,
in both directions:

* Its ``curriculum.live_sessions`` row is stored with ``status =
  'week-meeting'``. Every module-scoped read of that table in this project
  filters ``status = 'active'`` -- the create endpoint's duplicate check, the
  summary, the series read, the delivery metadata, the coach schedule and the
  post-save re-attach. None of them can see this row, so creating one here
  never blocks, supersedes, redirects or reschedules the module's own calendar,
  and the module's calendar is still created and updated exactly as before.

* Its join link is written to the component under its own ``extraTeams*``
  settings keys, never ``liveSessionUrl``/``live_sessions_link``.
  ``attach_teams_meeting_to_module_weeks`` rewrites those two on every
  component, every time the module is saved with a calendar -- storing the
  extra link there would have it silently replaced by the module's. Under its
  own keys it survives, because that function merges over the settings it finds
  rather than replacing them.

The two blocks this endpoint enforces are the author's, not incidental:

1. A week with no live-session component has nowhere to keep the link, so there
   is nothing to attach it to. Add a live session to the week first.
2. A live-session component that already holds an ADDITIONAL meeting is
   refused, so no additional meeting is ever replaced by another.

What is deliberately NOT a block is the module's own calendar link. That link
is written onto every live-session component whenever a module with a calendar
is saved, so treating it as "already taken" would make this feature unusable on
exactly the modules it is for. A week carrying the module's link is free to
take an additional meeting, and that link is left untouched when it does.

Only the people named on this form are invited, by Microsoft, on the one date
chosen. The meeting keeps one ``live_session_occurrences`` row (session 1) of
its own -- see ``save_week_meeting_occurrence`` -- so its recording, transcript
and attendance are synced and saved like any other live session's.

      the request is refused unless ``notifyAttendees`` is set.

      for them to be told. Anybody this save ADDS is reached either way: on the
      announced write when there is one, or by a forward of their own when the

      someone's calendar only when something is sent.
    * Somebody removed is taken off silently first, so no write here ever sends
      a cancellation. Only Cancel cancels.
