"""Where curriculum component uploads live.

Slide decks, reading PDFs, podcast audio and assignment briefs used to be written
to MEDIA_ROOT on whichever machine served the upload. The database only ever held
the path, so a file uploaded on one host was a 404 on every other host sharing
that database — which is exactly what happened to an authored deck whose row was
in the database while its bytes were on nobody's disk.

So the bytes belong in the kbcdocs storage account, in AZURE_CURRICULUM_CONTAINER,
and the database keeps holding a path. The stored path does not change: an upload
is still recorded as ``/curriculum_api/curriculum/uploads/<relative>``, which the
serving view resolves through this module. That keeps every settings_json
reference already in the database valid, whether its bytes are on local disk
(uploaded before this change, or a render cache) or in Azure.

Local disk stays the fallback in both directions: reads check it first, and when
Azure is not configured — a developer machine with no credentials — uploads go
there exactly as before.
