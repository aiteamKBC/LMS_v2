"""The one working-rules check a completion timestamp has to pass.

Learning itself is unrestricted: a learner opens what they like, when they
like, from wherever they like. This module is consulted at exactly one moment
-- when a learner presses Finish -- to decide whether the instant they are
claiming credit for is a legitimate working instant.

Two instants exist for every completion and they are deliberately different
things:

``submitted_at``   the real moment the learner pressed Finish. Immutable audit
                   evidence, never validated away, never overwritten.
``declared_at``    the working instant the learner states the work was actually
                   done at, supplied only after the first instant failed.

The holidays are the learner's OWN holidays. They are resolved through the
component's module to its cohort and handed to
``cohort_selected_holidays_by_cohort`` -- the same resolver the Module Builder,
the Teams series and the learner timeline already use, with the cohort's
``excluded_holiday_ids`` deny-list honoured upstream. A closure authored
against somebody else's programme therefore cannot close this learner's day,
and there is no second holiday store to keep in step.
