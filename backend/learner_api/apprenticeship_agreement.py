"""The Apprenticeship Agreement — issue, sign and retrieve.

A statutory contract of service between the apprentice and their employer
(ASCLA 2009 / the 2017 Regulations). It states the standard, the dates the
apprenticeship runs, and the planned off-the-job training hours, and is signed
by those two parties only — the training provider does not sign it (note 6).

Everything on the form is derived from our own records rather than typed twice:
  * apprentice name, employer name and address -> the learner's record
  * start / end dates                          -> the learner's own dates (the
    group delivery window is no longer stored on curriculum.groups)
  * planned off-the-job hours                  -> the learning plan total, the
    sum of total_otjh across the modules on their plan
  * duration of practical period               -> weeks between its start and end

Those values are SNAPSHOT onto the row when the agreement is issued. Once a
party signs, editing the learning plan or moving the group's dates must not
rewrite what they put their name to — so the row is the record, not a live view.

Fields with no source are left blank rather than guessed: an invented standard
version on a statutory document is worse than a line an officer completes.
