    ``enrolment_id`` is the real link and is tried first: it is the learner's id

    everything older by ``apply_learner_enrolment_id``.

    Email is kept only as a fallback, for profiles that predate that column and
    could not be matched during the backfill. It is a poor key — the two tables
    have independent primary-key sequences, so email was the only bridge
    available before, but a corrected address silently breaks it and two people
    sharing an address collide. Anything it resolves is repaired in passing, so
    the fallback empties itself over time.

    The primary-key fallback below is narrower still: it only helps legacy source
    rows that genuinely have no email.
