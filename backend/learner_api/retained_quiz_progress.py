"""Keep earned quiz results attached to the curriculum slot they were earned in.

A quiz attempt is stored against the quiz it graded, not the plan component
that offered it. Authors later re-point a quiz component at a different quiz,
or remove the component, and the learner's result then matches nothing in
their plan: the module reads as if the work was never done.

This is a read-only projection. It resolves the slot from the curriculum's own
history (the component's current link and its recorded revisions) and never
rewrites the learner's progress records or the curriculum.
