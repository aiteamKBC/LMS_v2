"""Book a new learner's first session with their case owner, at enrolment.

The first session used to be something the learner requested from their own
calendar once they were Active. It is now arranged *for* them while they are
being created, which is both earlier and simpler: the person enrolling them
picks a date and time, and the meeting exists before the learner ever signs in.

Booking here rather than from the learner calendar also sidesteps a constraint
that made the old route unusable for this: ``learner_calendar_book`` requires an
Active mirror with a coach (calendar.py, "Only Active learners can book coach
sessions"), and a learner being created is neither Active nor mirrored yet. The
case owner is already resolved to a name and email during creation, and
``reserve_coach_calendar_booking`` takes plain values, so nothing here needs the
mirror.

Two rules from the wider platform apply:

* Learners imported from Aptem (non-empty ``aptem_id``) already have a start
  date and a history behind them, so they are skipped entirely -- the same
  discriminator ``old_otjh.gate`` uses to decide who is a native LMS learner.
* A Microsoft outage must not fail the enrolment. The reservation is durable and
  the Graph sync is a separate step, so a failed sync leaves a recoverable
  booking and an honest report, never a fabricated success.

Times are UK wall clock throughout -- see ``UK`` below.
