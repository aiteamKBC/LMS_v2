"""Startup checks for the two-database assumption (ENROLMENT_GAP_ANALYSIS.md 7.2).

EnrolmentRouter sends every learner_api/enrolment_api model read and write to the
`enrolment` alias. But four call sites deliberately read through `default`,
because they query schemas the router does not govern:

  * apprenticeship_agreement._group_dates  -> curriculum.groups
  * learning_plan._rows                    -> curriculum.modules, curriculum.groups
  * training_plan_document._module_breakdown -> curriculum.weeks, curriculum.components
  * absence_reports                        -> "Learner".learner_attendance_details

`curriculum` is owned by curriculum_api, whose 11 migrations run on `default`, so
those reads belong there. That is only coherent while both aliases resolve to the
same Neon instance — which is what .env does today by setting a single
Database_url that both resolution chains fall back to.

Point ENROLMENT_DATABASE_URL somewhere else and the arrangement breaks silently:
the ORM reads enrolment.* from one database while raw SQL reads curriculum.* and
"Learner".* from another. Nothing in the code would notice. This check makes it
loud instead.

It warns rather than errors: a split may be a deliberate, planned migration, and
a hard error would make the app unstartable at exactly the moment someone is
working on it. Silence is the failure mode worth removing, not startup.
