"""Learner evidence upload/list/download API (Azure Blob Storage backed).

Lifecycle (see EVIDENCE_CLOUD.md):
    upload -> QUARANTINE container + evidence_files row (status 'pending')
           -> scan (see _scan; no scanner infra yet -> TODO)
           -> promote to APPROVED (status 'approved') and record the approved
              blob in "Learner"."Evidence"  ── OR ── move to REJECTED.
    download -> short-lived SAS URL, ONLY from the approved container, ONLY for
                approved rows.

Learners are addressed by (kind, id) like the rest of learner_api — this project
has no auth_user-based learners, so the generic spec's auth_user/DRF model is
adapted to plain CSRF-exempt JSON views keyed on kind+id.

    POST /learner_api/evidence/<kind>/<pk>/upload/   (multipart: file, section_ref)
    GET  /learner_api/evidence/<kind>/<pk>/          (optional ?section_ref= &status=)
    GET  /learner_api/evidence/<kind>/<pk>/<file_id>/download/
    DELETE /learner_api/evidence/<kind>/<pk>/<file_id>/   (own file, pre-submission)
