"""Keep Teams meeting recordings in Azure Blob instead of only in Graph.

Graph is not a storage guarantee. It goes down, its token requests fail on a
DNS blip, an application access policy can be dropped, and Microsoft's own
retention eventually deletes the recording outright -- any one of those takes
every past recording with it, because Graph is the only copy. A coaching
session that a learner or an auditor may need a year from now cannot live
somewhere this fragile.

So each recording is downloaded once and archived to a private container. The
row in Coach.coach_meeting_artifacts then carries both references: the Graph
artifact id it came from, and the blob it now lives in. Reads prefer the blob
and fall back to Graph while a recording has not been archived yet.

Nothing here is on the request path for booking or joining a meeting. Archiving
is slow (recordings run to hundreds of megabytes) and is driven by the
archive_meeting_recordings management command, not by a user waiting on a page.

Config: AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT / AZURE_STORAGE_KEY / AZURE_SAS_TTL_MINUTES and
AZURE_MEETING_RECORDINGS_CONTAINER, all read from backend/.env via settings.
