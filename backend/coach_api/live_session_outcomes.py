"""Display outcome for live sessions whose scheduled time has passed.

Kept apart from coach meetings (see meeting_outcomes): live sessions have
their own Teams attendance, calculated per occurrence into
curriculum.live_session_learner_attendance. This module only reads that
result; it never changes the occurrence, its meeting or its attendance.

A learner's calendar shows ``completed`` when that learner was present and
``ended`` otherwise. A coach's calendar shows ``completed`` when any learner was
present and ``ended`` otherwise.
