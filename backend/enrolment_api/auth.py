"""Authentication gate for the enrolment endpoints (BE-2).

Every enrolment view — the commercial board, the Extended ILR, the wizard
bootstrap, the generated documents, and the four `learner_api` statutory
documents — was reachable with no authentication at all. Anyone who could reach
the URL could read or patch a learner, and issue or sign a compliance document.

`@enrolment_login_required` closes that. Set `ENROLMENT_API_REQUIRE_AUTH=0` (or
false/no) to disable the gate entirely — intended only for local development and
test setups that have no session, never for a deployment.

Which identity counts
---------------------
The gate originally tested `request.user.is_authenticated` — Django's own auth.
Nothing in this platform ever signs a person in that way: people authenticate
through the `login` app, whose middleware resolves the `kbc_session` cookie into
``request.login_account`` and leaves ``request.user`` anonymous. The result was
that every one of these endpoints answered 401 to every real user, staff and
learner alike. Both identities are now accepted, so a Django-admin session keeps
working and a platform session finally does.

Who may reach whose record
--------------------------
Accepting the platform identity is not enough on its own. These endpoints are
addressed by learner id and had no ownership check, so "any authenticated user"
would have meant any learner reading — and *signing* — any other learner's
enrolment record and compliance documents.

So the gate is scoped by role:

* **staff / admin** — any learner. This is the boundary the enrolment console
  needs and the one this module always intended.
* **learner** — their own record only. They need it: a learner at the
  'Onboarding' status fills in this very wizard and signs their own ILR and
  apprenticeship agreement.
* **employer** — refused for now. Employers have their own portal
  (`learner_api.employer_portal`); scoping them here would be speculative.

A learner asking for somebody else's record gets **404, not 403**: a 403 would
confirm that the id exists, and this codebase already collapses failure modes
for that reason (see `login.invitations._load_token`).

An endpoint with no learner id in its URL cannot be ownership-checked, so it is
staff-only unless explicitly listed in ``UNSCOPED_VIEWS``. That way a new
unscoped endpoint fails closed rather than silently becoming readable by every
learner.
