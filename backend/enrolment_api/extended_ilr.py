"""Extended ILR + wizard draft read/write endpoint.

GET  /enrolment_api/extended-ilr/<kind>/<id>/   -> {answers, draft, meta}
PUT  /enrolment_api/extended-ilr/<kind>/<id>/   -> upsert, returns the same shape

`answers` is the wizard's IlrForm document and `draft` is every other wizard step
(personal details, skills radar, PLR, CV/job, policies), both stored verbatim as
jsonb. The server does not enumerate their fields — the ILR is reworded whenever
the ESFA revises it, and mirroring every question here would mean a backend change
for each edit. What the server does own is the envelope: which learner the row
belongs to, and the signature/completion flags other features report on, which are
derived from the document on every write so they cannot drift from it.

`draft` is optional on write: omitting it leaves any stored draft untouched, so a
caller that only has ILR data cannot silently wipe the other steps.
