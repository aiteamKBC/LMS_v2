"""Recording what a manual auditor changed, for the Audit Trail.

Two shapes of write live in this app and they need opposite treatment.

**The plan already logs itself.** ``plan_tables.log_plan_event`` appends to
``"Manual_audit".plan_events`` with the entity, the action, the value before,
the value after and the actor -- a revision log in all but name, called from ten
places covering group creation, archiving, membership, months, activities and
exemptions. Re-deriving those events from the plan tables would produce a second
and worse account of them, so this module records ``plan_events`` itself: one
hook surfaces all ten in the trail.

**The overrides log nothing.** ``learner_hours_overrides``,
``learner_profile_date_overrides``, ``activity_overrides`` and the sign-offs are
upserts carrying ``updated_by`` and ``updated_at``. Each says who touched it last
and nothing about what it held before -- and between them they decide a
learner's hours, which month their evidence counts in, and whether a month is
signed off. Those are recorded here at the statement.

A note on keys, because getting it wrong would have been silent and wrong.
``versioning`` indexes history by ONE column, and these tables have composite
primary keys: ``(aptem_id, period)``, ``(learner_id, programme_key,
report_month, signer_role)``. Keying on the first column alone would file every
month of a learner's overrides under the same entity, so each month's edit would
read as an edit to the previous month's. Each recorder therefore supplies a
synthetic key joining the real ones, and that is what the trail indexes.
