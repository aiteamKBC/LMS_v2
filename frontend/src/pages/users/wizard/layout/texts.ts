const INTRODUCTION = `## Shaping Tomorrow’s Business Leaders
Kent Business College offers world-class education in Project Management, Marketing, and Leadership to prepare you for success in today’s competitive business landscape.

## What is an Apprenticeship?
*The term ‘apprenticeship’ simply means learning while working, gaining practical skills and knowledge on the job, regardless of your age, background, or current job title. It is meant to support upskilling within the British workforce employed by British organisations. Apprenticeship does not mean being young, in a junior role, or earning a low income. In the UK, anyone working legitimately can take part in an apprenticeship.*

**The programme is structured to support your development each week with:**
- Interactive online sessions
- Programme materials and quizzes (focused on knowledge)
- Coach-guided assignments to strengthen your practice and writing.

**We call this developing the “habits of success”. That means:**
- Attending one online class a week
- Reading 5–10 pages a week
- Reflecting on your work and assignments

Doing this consistently builds not only your skills and understanding, but the mindset and momentum to succeed both in the apprenticeship and beyond.`;

const BEFORE_YOU_BEGIN = `## The Onboarding Stage
During this stage, you will be required to provide personal details and information regarding your qualifications. The purpose of this application is to help us confirm your eligibility for the apprenticeship funding.

## Eligibility for Apprenticeship Funding
Eligibility is determined by strict guidelines set forth by the UK Government’s Department for Education (DfE). Therefore, every step of the application process must be completed accurately and thoroughly to be considered for funding and successful enrolment in the programme.

## Supporting Evidence
**Documents you may need to include:**
- Valid proof of identification and residency status
- Evidence of your right to work in the UK (England only) for the full duration of the apprenticeship
- GCSE English certificate or an approved equivalent **(if applicable)**
- GCSE Maths certificate or an approved equivalent **(if applicable)**
- Professional qualification certificates **(if applicable)**
- Degree certificates and transcripts **(if applicable)**

Instructions on how to upload these documents will be provided within the application form.

## Application Guidance
If you exit the application before completing and submitting it, your progress will be saved.

**Please note: You will not be able to submit the form or proceed with your application unless all required fields are completed and all supporting documents are uploaded.** *Incomplete applications or missing documentation may result in delays in processing your request.*

## Application Review
Once submitted, the compliance team will review your application.
If you have any questions, feel free to email us at: [office@kentbusinesscollege.org](mailto:office@kentbusinesscollege.org)

**Good luck with your application!**`;

const NEXT_STEPS = `## Next Step: Book Your Compliance Meeting
The next step in your apprenticeship application process is to **book a compliance meeting as soon as possible**. This meeting is a key part of your onboarding and must be **attended by both you and your line manager**. Book a meeting using the following link:

[Book Compliance Meeting](https://outlook.office.com/book/StudentSupport1@kentbusinesscollege.com/s/EmOovIV5H0GGd131KDuFJQ2) (select “Compliance Meeting”)

## What Needs to Be Completed Before the Meeting?
**Before attending your compliance meeting, please ensure you have:**
- Ensured your employer has signed the apprenticeship agreement
- Asked your employer to add Kent Business College to the Digital Apprenticeship Service (DAS)
- Completed the initial Maths and English assessments at least 24 hours before the compliance meeting appointment (this is essential)

const PRIVACY_NOTICE = `**Training providers should ensure that all learners have seen this privacy notice as part of their enrolment process.**

This privacy notice is issued on behalf of the Secretary of State for the Department of Education (DfE) to inform learners about the Individualised Learner Record (ILR) and how their personal information is used in the ILR. Your personal information is used by the DfE to exercise our functions under article 6(1)(e) of the UK GDPR and to meet our statutory responsibilities, including under the Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Act 2009. Our lawful basis for using your special category personal data is covered under Substantial Public Interest based in law (Article 9(2)(g)) of UK GDPR legislation. This processing is under Section 54 of the Further and Higher Education Act (1992).

The ILR collects data about learners and learning undertaken. Publicly funded colleges, training organisations, local authorities, and employers (FE providers) must collect and return the data each year under the terms of a funding agreement, contract or grant agreement. It helps ensure that public money is being spent in line with government targets. It is also used for education, training, employment, and well-being purposes, including research.

We retain your ILR learner data for 20 years for operational purposes (e.g. to fund your learning and to publish official statistics). Your personal data is then retained in our research databases until you are aged 80 years so that it can be used for long-term research purposes. For more information about the ILR and the data collected, please see the ILR specification at [https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/individualised-learner-record-ilr](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/individualised-learner-record-ilr)

ILR data is shared with third parties where it complies with DfE data sharing procedures and where the law allows it. The DfE and the English European Social Fund (ESF) Managing Authority (or agents acting on their behalf) may contact learners to carry out research and evaluation to inform the effectiveness of training.

For more information about how your personal data is used and your individual rights, please see the DfE Personal Information Charter [(https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-education/about/personal-information-charter)](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-education/about/personal-information-charter) and the DfE Privacy Notice [(https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/privacy-notice-for-key-stage-5-and-adult-education)](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/privacy-notice-for-key-stage-5-and-adult-education)

If you would like to get in touch with us or request a copy of the personal information DfE holds about you, you can contact the DfE in the following ways:
- Using our online contact form [https://form.education.gov.uk/service/Contact_the_Department_for_Education](https://form.education.gov.uk/service/Contact_the_Department_for_Education)
- By telephoning the DfE Helpline on 0370 000 2288
- Or in writing to: Data Protection Officer, Department for Education, 4th floor, 2 St Paul’s Place, 125 Norfolk Street, Sheffield, S1 2FJ

If you are unhappy with how we have used your personal data, you can complain to the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) at: Wycliffe House, Water Lane, Wilmslow, Cheshire, SK9 5AF. You can also call their helpline on 0303 123 1113 or visit [https://www.ico.org.uk](https://www.ico.org.uk)
