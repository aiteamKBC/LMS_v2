// "The Teams calendar has not moved with these dates."
//
// Changing a module's dates, or a group's delivery days, regenerates the plan
// this system holds. It does not touch the Teams series that plan was sent to:
// that calendar lives in the organizer's mailbox, and nothing about a date
// change reaches it on its own. Without something said at the moment of the
// edit the two quietly disagree -- the module shows the new days while everyone
// invited still holds the old invitations -- and the difference is only found by
// opening the module's Teams tab and reading "On the plan's dates: No".
//
// So the saves that move dates name the affected calendars back, and this is the
// one thing every screen that makes such a change says about them. When a single
// module is affected the new dates can be sent from the dialog itself: the walk
// to the Teams Meetings page to press one button was the step the change used to
// be left undone in. Several at once still go to that page, because pushing a
// run of series means a round of update and cancellation mail per series and
// that should be set off against a list, not a count.
