// "Which calendar runs each week" -- one live session, one calendar.
//
// A week delivered by both the module's own series and an additional meeting is
// the failure this prevents: the series books the same date, and its next
// Update writes its link over the additional meeting's. So every live session
// nobody has booked yet is put to the author here, and the answer is final for
// both doors: a week given to the module calendar is refused an additional
// meeting, and one given to an additional meeting is left out of every date
// the module calendar sends.
//
// Only unbooked live sessions are listed. A booking is changed by cancelling
// it -- on the calendar that holds it -- never by a toggle here.
//
// The panel has two faces, because it has two jobs. While a week is on neither
// calendar it is a question nobody may walk past: an amber card, open, saying
// in the header itself -- which stays visible when the card is shut -- that the
// week is not being sent to Teams. The moment every week has an answer it stops
// asking and shuts itself: a settled choice is a record to look up, not a row
// of controls left open in front of the dates it has already decided. It
// reopens on a click, and on the next week that arrives unrouted.
