/**
 * Report what a person does anywhere in the LMS, for the Audit Trail's People
 * view.
 *
 * The change trail is written by the backend's own save helpers, so it already
 * knows every edit it covers. What it cannot know is the reading: somebody
 * opening a coach's caseload, searching it and leaving touches no record, so
 * nothing anywhere records that it happened. That half has to be reported by
 * the browser, and this is the only place that does it.
 *
 * Three rules this file exists to keep:
 *
 * 1. **It never affects the page.** Every failure is swallowed, the queue is
 *    bounded, and nothing here is awaited by a render or a save. If the
 *    endpoint is down, or the table has not been created yet, the person
 *    notices nothing at all.
 * 2. **It says nothing the server must believe.** The account, the page name,
 *    the workspace and the record id in a URL are all resolved server-side
 *    against `system_audit/pages.py`. What goes up is the route, the kind of
 *    action, and short descriptive detail.
 * 3. **It reports actions, never content.** A search records that a search
 *    happened and the term typed; it never records the results, the payload or
 *    anything on screen.
 *
 * Scope is the whole LMS, minus `EXCLUDED_PREFIXES` below. The exclusions are
 * mirrored server-side in `system_audit/pages.py` and enforced there too: what
 * the LMS does not record is a decision, and a decision like that cannot live
 * only in code the client could skip.
