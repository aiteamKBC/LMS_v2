 * off (security audit finding A10 — an unauthenticated identity bootstrap). This
 * flag removes every chat entry point from the UI: the "Messages" sidebar items
 * are filtered out (see mocks/navigation.ts) and the /messages and
 * /learner/messages routes redirect away (see router/config.tsx).
 *
 * To re-enable chat, flip this one constant to `true`. Do NOT re-enable without
 * the backend rebuild described in SECURITY_AUDIT.md (A18) — turning the UI back
 * on against the current backend reopens A10.
