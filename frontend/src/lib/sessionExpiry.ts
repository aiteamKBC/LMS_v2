/**
 * Notice when the server stops recognising this browser, and say so once.
 *
 * The problem this solves is new. The API used to answer anonymous callers, so
 * a lapsed session mostly went unnoticed; now that `login/api_gate.py` refuses
 * them, an expired or revoked session turns every panel on the page into an
 * error at the same moment, with nothing telling the person why. Sessions do
 * lapse — they expire, an administrator revokes one, the account is
 * deactivated, or the person signed out in another tab.
 *
 * Catching it per call site is not realistic: roughly forty modules under
 * `api/` and `lib/` each own their own `fetch`, and a new one is written most
 * weeks. So this wraps `window.fetch` itself — the one place every request
 * already passes through — and reports a 401 from a gated API prefix to a
 * single listener, which `AuthProvider` registers.
 *
 * Three things it is careful about:
 *
 *  - **It only reads `response.status`.** The response is handed back
 *    untouched, so no caller loses its body and nothing needs `clone()`.
 *  - **`/login_api/` is excluded.** `apiMe` 401s on every page load for a
 *    signed-out visitor, and a wrong password 401s too. Both are normal answers
 *    from the endpoint that issues sessions, not evidence one has ended.
 *  - **It fires once.** A dashboard opening twelve panels gets twelve 401s
 *    within a few milliseconds; the person should be told once, not bounced
 *    twelve times. `notified` latches until `resetSessionExpiryNotice`, which
 *    the next successful sign-in calls.
 *
 * A 403 is deliberately not treated as expiry: the session is fine, the account
 * is simply not admitted to that API. Signing someone out for it would hide a
 * routing bug behind a logout.
