// ============================================================================
// The workspaces the platform offers as a launcher.
//
// One definition, two consumers:
//   * components/feature/WorkspaceSwitcher — the top-bar switcher an
//                             administrator uses to change section. Replaced a
//                             five-card panel on the Super Admin dashboard,
//                             which could only be reached from the dashboard —
//                             so changing section meant going home first.
//   * pages/home            — the public "Explore your portal" launcher, which
//                             enters each one as its demo account (previewAs).
//
// The two consumers do NOT show the same rows. Super Admin is in the switcher,
// because an administrator moving to it is ordinary navigation, but it has no
// `demoEmail` and so never appears on the public launcher: that launcher signs
// anyone in as the named account with no password, and the one account that
// must not be handed out that way is the one that administers the platform.
// A null demoEmail is the whole rule — see the filter in pages/home.
//
// Kept here rather than in either place so the two cannot drift, and every
// `path` is a real route in router/config.tsx — a launcher offering a section
// that leads nowhere is worse than one that omits it.
//
// Curated, not exhaustive. The sidebar's roleNavMap knows every role the app
// has; this is the set of sections worth switching between. A switcher listing
// everything routable is a directory, not a shortcut.
//
// This list also replaced `components/feature/RoleSwitcher.tsx`, a dead
// component carrying its own copy of the same mapping. A real administrator
// already has access to every section, so moving between them is navigation,
// not a change of role — the switcher never touches RBAC state.

/**
 * Which workspace a path belongs to, so the switcher can show where you are.

 * Longest match wins, which is the whole reason this is a function rather than a
 * `find`: some paths are prefixes of others. `/workspace/auditor-copy` starts
 * with `/workspace/auditor`, and every `/workspace/learner/:kind/:id` starts
 * with `/workspace/learner` — taking the first prefix hit would light up the
 * wrong row, or the right one for the wrong reason.
 *
 * The segment boundary matters too: `/users-report` is not inside `/users`.
 *
 * Returns null anywhere outside these sections — Leadership, an admin settings
 * page such as /admin/roles — which the switcher renders as a neutral
 * "Workspaces" label rather than claiming you are somewhere you are not. Note
 * that /admin/* is not inside /workspace/admin: those pages are reached from the
 * Super Admin sidebar but are not the workspace's own route.
