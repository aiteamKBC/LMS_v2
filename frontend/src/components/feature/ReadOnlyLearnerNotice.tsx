   READ-ONLY LEARNER NOTICE — shown in place of an activity
   runner, or an upload form, when the viewer is not the
   learner whose workspace is open.

   The learner pages are reachable by staff two ways: through
   the training-plan rows (now inert — see useLearnerWorkspaceAccess)
   and by URL, either pasted or from the browser's history. This
   is what the second route lands on, so a deep link explains
   itself instead of opening a quiz nobody is allowed to submit.
